# Bao's Project: Server Monitoring Application

I am planning on creating a monitoring tool for the servers I have to monitor at work. It would be nice to have a website that can monitor whether or not the servers are running and which processes are running.

### Problem Statement

I currently support many servers at my job. It would be very useful to have an application that can monitor the server activities on one webpage. Often times, end users will discover that servers are performing slow or have completely crashed before I do. I would like to have this knowledge as it's happening and be able to monitor the servers from one interface. I want to see what is running on each server, the amount of memory each process is using, the amount of memory left on the server, and of course, if the server is down. I would like to have this application to have a login screen to prevent unauthorized users from seeing this data. I also need to keep in mind that this application has to have the highest level of security as possible to ensure that this program will not allow malicious software to attack the servers it's accessing.
